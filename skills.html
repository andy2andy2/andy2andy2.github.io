<p>Over the years at Georiga Gwinnett College I have participated in different events and recieved a few awards and certificates. </p>

<br>

<h2>Certifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>A+ 220-1101 - While at University of North Georgia, I earned the CompTIA A+ 1101. This is the first section of the A+, so I do not offically have the certifcation, I wanted to invest in a more challenging certification. </li>
<br>
<li>Amazon Web Service Practicioner Certification - Entry level cloud computing certificate using AWS, this was through GGC's cloud computing class</li>
<br>
<li>Network+ - I am currently studying for the ComptTIA network+. This certifcation is a comprehensive and detailed test for my first 2 years in College. It is important to master the fundamentals before working on more advance concepts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Awards and Events</h2>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition </dt>
<dd>This is a mock cyber security environment, with students configuring a given network enviornment(blue team) and the host of the event being the offensive actors(red team). 
This has been the most important event in my tech career so far. Months leading up to it, the team was practicing and studying the basics of networking, linux, and amazon web services. The day of we were exposed to even more details of these concepts that 
we did not know existed. Unfortunately, we placed below around 17 of 30 but it was a humbling experience to be completely flattened by experts and it confirmed that this is what I want to do with my time.
<br>
<dt>Women in Technology Hack-a-thon</dt>
<dd>A Hack-a-thon is usually a 5-24 hour event that gives the participants challenges relating to the Technology.  In this case it tackled cryptography, web technologies, programming, and more. Sponsered by Women in Technology
 I formed a group of 3 with other students in the club and we walked through the easy challenges together and split off after things got difficult. Studying for this event included going through the HackTheBox , an online cybersecurity training platform.
 This event was my first Hack-a-thon and I greatly enjoyed the variety of different skills that were involved in this. </dd>
<br>
<dt>National Cyber League by Cyber Skyline</dt>
<dd>This is a weekend Hack-a-thon, that has a training gym similar to HackTheBox. I spent a couple of hours a week in the gym, but this was during the same time that I had a large school load, and the SECCDC.
I did not participate in the weekend Hack-a-thon due to impostor syndrome. However I will be signing up and dedicating time towards it this fall semester. NCL covers the same concepts as the WIT Hack-a-thon, and HackTheBox
