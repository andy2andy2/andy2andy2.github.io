<dt><h2>Landscape</h2></dt>
<br>
<dd>Since the age of 10, I have been working with my dad in the family landscaping business. I am aiding in the lawn maintence aspect of it by tending to the lawncare, fixing machines, collecting payment, or giving quotes.
More than that I am a personal assistant to him, doing task in his name so that he can focus on his landscape projects. </dd>
<br>
<dt><h2>Service Industry</h2></dt>
<br>
<dd>Begining working with my aunt at IHOP in high school, I wanted to try out something different than landscape. Since then I picked up different roles in kitchens, specifically in Athens, Georgia. 
Home to the Dawgs, this town has a large influx of football fans during the fall season leading to high volume service industry work. From corporate resturants like Red Lobster and Cracker barrel, to locally founded kithcens
such as the Blind Pig Tavern, and The Cafe on Lumpkin. I have enjoyed the fast pace environments that relies on strong communications with other parts of the resturant. I found my place in the kitchen line where time and resource 
management, were essential for ticket times and quality of food.</dd>
<br>
<dt><h2>Miscellaneous</h2></dt>
<br>
<dd>I have came across various gigs in between jobs, life events, and on the weekends. Family friends have given me opportunies in cabinet building, floor carpet installations, and electriction assistant work. 
Through a friend, I got work in building armored cars in a workshop, gutting out the stock parts and installing custom parts. Another friend, runs a store on ebay selling vintage oddity goods like commador computers, crystals, 
comic books, and anything that has good value, learning about the market and the product was insightful in trival information that can be helplful in a given situation.
